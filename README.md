# Senior-Project
For my senior honors project

The Initial Testing folder houses some simple programs. They were created in order to test the functionality of the Unity3D engine with the Oculus Quest headset.

The HCI PA3 on Quest is a port of project number three from Dr. Xiao's Human Computer Interface class. The program was originally created for use with the Leap Motion
hand tracking device. It is now functional on the Oculus Quest VR headset. Oculus's hand tracking features were implemented in the project to replace Leap Motion.
