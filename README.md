# Senior-Project

This repository houses my senior honors project.

## Initial Testing Folder
The Initial Testing folder houses some simple programs. They were created in order to test the functionality of the Unity3D engine with the Oculus Quest headset.

## HCI PA3 Folder
The HCI PA3 on Quest is a port of project number three from Dr. Xiao's Human Computer Interface class. The program was originally created for use with the Leap Motion
hand tracking device. It is now functional on the Oculus Quest VR headset. Oculus's hand tracking features were implemented in the project to replace Leap Motion.

## Senior Project Folder
The Senior Project folder houses the actual senior project (Interactive Virtual Reality Reading Experience).
