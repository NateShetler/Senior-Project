This version has two scripts that can "communicate" by looking at one anothers variables. The two scripts are: forwardPageButton.cs and pageTurner.cs

The variable used to communicate is called forwardPressed which functions as a boolean indicating that the forward button has been pressed.

THe initial test for this functionality just "changes" scenes, but will soon allow the user to flip the pages of the book.
